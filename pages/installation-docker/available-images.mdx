The `pg` image is the latest version of Archetypal that are **specifically** built use with a local or remote PostgreSQL database.

This image has a slightly different startup command to support the PostgreSQL deployment and does the following:
- Will store all Archetypal data in the PostgreSQL database
- Will by default use **PGVector** for vector storage - **requires** a PGVector extension to be installed on the PostgreSQL database

See the [PostgreSQL image deployment command](/installation-docker/quickstart#pg-image-startup-command) for more information.
