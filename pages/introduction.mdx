# What is Archetypal?

Archetypal is the easiest to use, **all-in-one** AI application that can do RAG, AI Agents, and much more with no code or infrastructure headaches.

Archetypal is built by [AI Labs, Inc](https://github.com/archetypalsai) - founded by Benjamin Harvey and Alvin McClerkin.
Archetypal is **not a one-person project**. The Mintplex Labs team also includes:

- Drake Austin
- Bryce Harvey
- Ar'Shaun Moore
- Kola Ogunlana

<br />

# Why use Archetypal?

You need a **fully-customizable**, **private**, and all-in-one AI app for your _business or organization_ that is basically a full ChatGPT with permissioning but with any LLM, embedding model, or vector database.
